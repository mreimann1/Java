# SimulatedTreeShell

This is a simulated filesystem built on a Tree structure. It is meant to be a simulation of the inode
 structure of a linux-based filesystem.
 
 This project gave me significant practice with:
 - maps
 - shared pointers
 - tree structures (specifically, non-binary)
 - virtual functions
